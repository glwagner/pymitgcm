Why use pyMITgcm
================

The MITgcm takes a large number of input files, and numerous parameters appear in multiple files. It is easy to forget to change a parameter in one file, which dooms the run to failure, or worse, means that the simulation runs but the results are not what was intended. pyMITgcm solves this problem.
